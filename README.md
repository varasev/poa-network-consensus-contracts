## Setup of the ceremony

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.5+, pip
- solc, the Solidity compiler

### Start POA network

- Install solidity-flattener `pip3.5 install solidity-flattener`
- Install npm dependencies `npm i`
- Generate flat sources of contracts with the script `./make_flat.sh`
- We need the byte code of `PoaNetworkConsensus_flat` contract to add it to [`spec.json`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/core/spec.json) of the network. <br />
Go to [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.4.18+commit.9cf6e910.js).<br />
Copy `./flat/PoaNetworkConsensus_flat.sol` source to the input field and press `Start to compile`. <br />
Choose `PoaNetworkConsensus` contract in the listbox and press "Details". Copy `BYTECODE` of the compiled source for `spec.json`.

### Add Contracts to Parity UI.

Start Parity UI. In the contracts section press `Develop` button. 
Select `0.4.18` Solidity compiler version. Set `Optimize` to `true`.

- In Parity UI `Contracts` tab choose watch custom contract. Paste bytecode and ABI of `PoaNetworkConsensus` contract from Remix.

Compile and deploy contracts in the next sequence:

- `ProxyStorage_flat.sol` - Select contract `ProxyStorage`.
- `EternalStorageProxy_flat.sol` - Select contract `EternalStorageProxy` with constructor parameters: <br />
`_proxyStorage` - equal to zero,
`_implementationAddress` - address of ProxyStorage contract.
-  Make a call to `ProxyStorage init` with `_poaConsensus` parameter equal to the address of poaConsensus contract, using the address of `EternalStorageProxy` and ABI of `ProxyStorage`.
-  Select `poaNetworkConsensus` contract and send transaction `setProxyStorage` with the address of ProxyStorage contract.
- `KeysManager_flat.sol` - Select contract `KeysManager` with constructor parameters:  <br />
`_proxyStorage` - address of ProxyStorage contract,
`_poaConsensus` - address of poaConsensus contract,
`_masterOfCeremony` - address of Master of Ceremony,
`_previousKeysManager` - equal to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
- `BallotsStorage_flat.sol` - Select contract `BallotsStorage`.
- `EternalStorageProxy_flat.sol` - Select contract `EternalStorageProxy` with constructor parameters: <br />
`_proxyStorage` - address of ProxyStorage contract,
`_implementationAddress` - address of BallotsStorage contract.
-  Make a call to `BallotsStorage init` with `_demoMode` parameter equal to `false`, using the address of `EternalStorageProxy` and ABI of `BallotsStorage`.
- `VotingToChangeKeys_flat.sol` - Select contract `VotingToChangeKeys`.
- `EternalStorageProxy_flat.sol` - Select contract `EternalStorageProxy` with constructor parameters: <br />
`_proxyStorage` - address of ProxyStorage contract,
`_implementationAddress` - address of VotingToChangeKeys contract.
-  Make a call to `VotingToChangeKeys init` with `_demoMode` parameter equal to `false`, using the address of `EternalStorageProxy` and ABI of `VotingToChangeKeys`.
- `VotingToChangeMinThreshold_flat.sol` - Select contract `VotingToChangeMinThreshold`.
- `EternalStorageProxy_flat.sol` - Select contract `EternalStorageProxy` with constructor parameters: <br />
`_proxyStorage` - address of ProxyStorage contract,
`_implementationAddress` - address of VotingToChangeMinThreshold contract.
-  Make a call to `VotingToChangeMinThreshold init` with `_demoMode` parameter equal to `false`, using the address of `EternalStorageProxy` and ABI of `VotingToChangeMinThreshold`.
- `VotingToChangeProxyAddress_flat.sol` - Select contract `VotingToChangeProxyAddress` with constructor parameters: <br />
`_proxyStorage` - address of ProxyStorage contract,
`_demoMode` - equal to false.
- `ValidatorMetadata_flat.sol` - Select contract `ValidatorMetadata`.
- `EternalStorageProxy_flat.sol` - Select contract `EternalStorageProxy` with constructor parameters: <br />
`_proxyStorage` - address of ProxyStorage contract,
`_implementationAddress` - address of ValidatorMetadata contract.
-  Select deployed `ProxyStorage` contract and make a call from MoC address to `initializeAddresses` with relevant addresses.
